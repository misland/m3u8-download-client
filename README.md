# WHY repeat build the wheel
Its practical ffmpeg can be downloaded directly according to the m3u8 file, but some m3u8 files do not have the complete url ðŸ˜‘. If you want to download with ffmpeg at this time, it will be more troublesome. You need to manually edit the m3u8 file to fill in the urls of all fragments. This is ten thousand. Unacceptable, trouble! ! !

# for chinese doc
![ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](./README_CN.md)
# prerequisite
## have installed nodejs
## have installed ffmpeg and add ffmpeg executor to the system path

# advantage
It only relies on nodejs at runtime, without any third-party libraries, and no node_modules black holeðŸ˜ƒ

# ç”¨æ³•
find your m3u8 file in browser,as follow:
![m3u8](./sample/mouxun.jpg)
save the file and give it a simple name such asï¼š111<br>
import index.js fileï¼Œthen build a client instanceï¼Œcall `download` to begin download
there will be a mp4 file when download successfully<br>
The constructor currently receives five parameters, the specific definitions are as follows:
+ fileï¼šthe name of the m3u8 file to be downloaded , you only need to pass in the name, no extension is required, such as 111.m3u8 directly pass 111.
+ prefixï¼šSome m3u8 file urls only have the ts file name without the prefix url. This parameter is used to set the prefix url. If the m3u8 contains a complete url, pass an empty string '' instead of null
+ hasParamï¼šthe url in some m3u8 files contains parameters. Setting these parameters to true can parse the ts fragment file name correctly
+ deleteTemFileï¼šwhether delete the cache file when download completely
+ outputï¼šthe final output mp4 file name, such as save as 222.mp4, just input 222

take tencent video as an example:
```
let client = new download('222',
  'https://apd-efe7721cc90c5d225f6c5248371a6c58.v.smtcdns.com/omts.tc.qq.com/AOuvIp8ucBrJsCNI07u9ClgmEZFAKjLICgUl8_cp9ORs/uwMROfz2r5zIIaQXGdGnC2df645AHpR-pVjI5hvW8Wk822MC/dT_ZjXy6-zkrzNHhNoHTTiUE3UIfML_SsEA37_lIo9itKxb5M4YMJ8uYZ4Yk2W8u2tp0ec1FIxdhJ2Zk-dPGNXp15g-D17kXWuSWfSO-2cXM5dsBuPKTdQH9ckEuNIfW67e3EkUfHj1eNu36veLHP75MD4spo2l8lNkwhZhKOCpS9aqJrsVmEw/',
  true,
  false);
```
take youku video as an example:<br>
`let client2 = new download('111', '', true, false);`
